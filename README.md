# Serverin-Devops-Integration
Integrating Automation tool with Docker, AWS and Hadoop tool for one click setup architecture
## Abstract
  Students on enrolling to graduation curriculum usually are
deficient with the computing resources. The second obstacle comes as the
Operating System interface. Mostly while schooling students are acquainted
with Windows Operating System but the college and the industry uses Linux
Operating System. A complete new interface makes them a little
uncomfortable. Even not every student possess Linux Operating system in
his/her personal computing unit.
  With a goal to access Linux OS on the available computing unit a
student may choose either of the ways â€“ installing Linux OS as the base OS,
installing Linux OS on Virtual box or partitioning and installing Linux OS. The
Main issue that one gets is LACK OF SPACE. This project aims for providing
a platform to the population to where they can launch their required OS
easily and run the application as per their need.
  This design plans to provide facility of launching an Operating System
on Docker, launching a Hadoop cluster to manage the Big data, performing
partitioning using Logical Volume Manager (LVM), launching AWS instances
using python scripts. These facilities are automated using the automating
tool Ansible.In this project the technologies like Ansible, Hadoop, Docker,
AWS cloud is used. This project has the frontend formed of Django scripts.
Python language is mainly used behind the scenes.
  This results to available the public the computing resources at their
fingertips. They would be able to code, build, run, test and deploy their
applications as per their requirements.The forecasted design is proposed to
minimize the consumption of resources upto 70% on the local host. The
availed storage is isolated and thus resulting an increase in availability of
data over distributed storage by 90%. Thus, the motto is to provide the
designed platform under the roof of DevOps tools to automate the featured
facilities and aquatinting the student community with the use cases of the
technologies.
