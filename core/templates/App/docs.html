    <strong>
        Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    </strong>
    &nbsp;started to offer IT services to the market in the form of web services, which is nowadays known as&nbsp;
    <strong>
        cloud computing
    </strong>
    . With this cloud, we need not plan for servers and other IT infrastructure which takes up much of time in advance.
    Instead, these services can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results
    faster. We pay only for what we use with no up-front expenses and no long-term commitments, which makes AWS cost
    efficient.
</p>

<p>
    AWS has significantly more services, and more features within those services, than any other cloud
    provider&ndash;from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases&ndash;
</p>

<p>
    to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and
    Internet of Things.
</p>

<p>
    This makes it faster, easier, and more cost effective to move your existing applications to the cloud and build
    nearly anything you can imagine.
</p>

<p>
    &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
    AWS has the most extensive global cloud infrastructure. No other cloud provider offers as many Regions with multiple
    Availability Zones connected by low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking. AWS has 80
    Availability Zones within 25 geographic regions around the world, and has announced plans for 15 more Availability
    Zones and 5 more AWS Regions in Australia, India, Indonesia, Spain, and Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
    &nbsp;The AWS Region/Availability Zone model has been recognized by Gartner as
</p>

<p>
    the recommended approach for running enterprise applications that require high availability.

<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently
    store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes of data. Instead of using one large
    computer to store and process the data, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to analyze massive datasets in
    parallel more quickly.
</p>

<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This large sets of data is technically termed as Big Data. Big Data can be
    the data that is difficult to process on a single machine. The problems with Big Data is not only the size . There
    are three V&rsquo;s associated with Big Data that makes it difficult to process on a single machine.
</p>

<ol>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">

        <strong>
            Volume&nbsp;
        </strong>
        : The size of the data being generated.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">

        <strong>
            Velocity&nbsp;
        </strong>
        : The rate at which the data is being generated
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">

        <strong>
            Variety
        </strong>
        : the different sources and formats in which the data is coming
    </li>

</ol>

<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hadoop was inspired by Google&rsquo;s Map Reduce and Google Files System
    projects. The idea was to develop an open source framework where anyone can write map reduce jobs without worrying
    about Hardware Failures.
</p>

<p>
    Hadoop consists of four main modules:
</p>

        HDFS

        Working of Hadoop:
    </strong>

</h2>

<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hadoop provides the building blocks on which other services and applications can
    be built.
</p>

<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Applications that collect data in various formats can place data into the Hadoop
    cluster by using an API operation to connect to the NameNode. The NameNode tracks the file directory structure and
    placement of &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; for each file, replicated across DataNodes. To run a job to query the data,
    provide a
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/">
        MapReduce
    </a>
    &nbsp;job made up of many map and reduce tasks that run against the data in HDFS spread across the DataNodes. Map
    tasks run on each node against the input files supplied, and reducers run to aggregate and organize the final
    output.

<h2>

    <strong>
        Features of Hadoop:
    </strong>

</h2>

<ol>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        Hadoop is open-source, which means it is free to use. Since it is an open-source project the source-code is
        available online for anyone to understand it or make some modifications as per their industry requirement.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        Hadoop is a highly scalable model. A large amount of data is divided into multiple inexpensive machines in a
        cluster which is processed parallelly. the number of these machines or nodes can be increased or decreased as
        per the enterprise&rsquo;s requirements
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        In Hadoop data is replicated on various DataNodes in a Hadoop cluster which ensures the availability of data if
        somehow any of your systems got crashed. You can read all of the data from a single machine if this machine
        faces a technical issue data can also be read from other nodes in a Hadoop cluster because the data is copied or
        replicated by default. By default, Hadoop makes 3 copies of each file block and stored it into different nodes.
        This replication factor is configurable and can be changed by changing the replication property in the&nbsp;
        <em>
            hdfs-site.xml
        </em>

    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        High Availability means the availability of data on the Hadoop cluster. Due to fault tolerance in case if any of
        the DataNode goes down the same data can be retrieved from any other node where the data is replicated. The High
        available Hadoop cluster also has 2 or more than two Name Node i.e. Active NameNode and Passive NameNode also
        known as stand by NameNode. In case if Active NameNode fails then the Passive node will take the responsibility
        of Active Node and provide the same data as that of Active NameNode which can easily be utilized by the user.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        Hadoop is open-source and uses cost-effective commodity hardware which provides a cost-efficient model, unlike
        traditional Relational databases that require expensive hardware and high-end processors to deal with Big Data.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        Hadoop is designed in such a way that it can deal with any kind of dataset like structured(MySql Data),
        Semi-Structured(XML, JSON), Un-structured (Images and Videos) very efficiently.&nbsp;
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        The concept of Data Locality is used to make Hadoop processing fast.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        Hadoop uses a distributed file system to manage its storage i.e. HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System). In
        DFS(Distributed File System) a large size file is broken into small size file blocks then distributed among the
        Nodes available in a Hadoop cluster, as this massive number of file blocks are processed parallelly which makes
        Hadoop faster, because of which it provides a High-level performance as compared to the traditional DataBase
        Management Systems.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely
    isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously
    on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need
    to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that
    everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:
</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;">
        When you&rsquo;re ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an
        orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud
        provider, or a hybrid of the two.
    </li>

</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">

    <strong>
        Fast, consistent delivery of your applications
    </strong>

</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to
    work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers
    are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Consider the following example scenario:
</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">

    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">
        Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">
        They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and execute automated and manual tests.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">
        When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test
        environment for testing and validation.
    </li>

    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">
        When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the
        production environment.
    </li>

</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">

    <strong>
        Responsive deployment and scaling
    </strong>

</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Docker&rsquo;s container-based platform allows for highly portable
    workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer&rsquo;s local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data
    center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Docker&rsquo;s portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to
    dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in
    near real time.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">

    <strong>
        Running more workloads on the same hardware
    </strong>

</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective
    alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity to achieve your
    business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need
    to do more with fewer resources.
